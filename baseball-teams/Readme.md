### Assessment 1: Baseball team name list

As a user,\
When I visit the webpage of the National League East baseball teams (baseball.html),\
I see the team names listed as li tag elements that are blue and sized 2 em.

1. Fork the repository to your organization 
2. Clone the repository to your local machine
3. cd into the directory
4. From the command line, open the HTML page in the browser. `open baseball.html`
5. Complete the user story, commit and push your work to GitHub
6. Add your instructors as collaborators so they can review your work.

Good luck!
