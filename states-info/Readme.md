### Assessment 3: US States

As a user,\
when I visit the state info webpage,\
I see buttons with states on them.\
When I click on a button,\
I would like to see the state name and its details including: capital, statehood year, timezone.\
When I click on a different state button I would like the old state data to disappear and be replaced with the new state data.

**Bonus:** Display the tourist attractions 

**Note/Hint:** Check the data type you are given!

1. Fork the repository to your organization 
2. Clone the repository to your local machine
3. cd into the directory
4. From the command line, open the HTML page in the browser. `open states.html`
5. Complete the user story, commit and push your work to GitHub
6. Add your instructors as collaborators so they can review your work.

Good luck!
