### Assessment 2: Grocery list

As a user,\
When I visit the to do list webpage,\
I see a text input field and a submit button.\
When I enter a grocery item into the input field and click submit,\
I should see the item added to the list and\
the text input field should be cleared so that I may enter the next grocery item.

**Bonus:** Add the item to the top of the list

1. Fork the repository to your organization 
2. Clone the repository to your local machine
3. cd into the directory
4. From the command line, open the HTML page in the browser. `open grocery-list.html`
5. Complete the user story, commit and push your work to GitHub
6. Add your instructors as collaborators so they can review your work.

Good luck!
